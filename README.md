An another super barebones color bot. It can:  
* Create color roles for users
* Change color of user's color role
* Clean users from color
* Enable/disable roles

Stock commands:
!setchannel - to select channel, where bot would operate
!robl - help
!colorme <hexcode\> or \<random> - change color
!cleanme - delete color
!toggle \<role> - to add/delete user role
!cleancolors (admin only) - deletes all color roles from server

To launch bot, past your app token instead of 'token' placehoder, install nodejs and do node r.js in bot's directory.

I made this bot mainly for myself, but if you interested in simple bot with this set functions, give me notice, I would translate it and add ability to save remeber channels.
